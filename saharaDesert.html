        <h1>information on the Sahara Desert</h1>
        <p>The sahara is the world's largest and hotest desert in the world.
            It is third largest desert overall after Antarctica and the Arctic, which are cold deserts.
            At 3.6 million square miles,the Sahara, which is Arabic for "The Great Desert," engulfs most of North Africa. 
            The desert covers large sections of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia.
            <br>
            The Sahara is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the western edge,
            the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea to the north,
            the Red Sea on the east, and the Sudan and the valley of the Niger River on the south.
            The Sahara is divided into western Sahara, the central Hoggar (Ahaggar) Mountains, 
            the Tibesti Mountains, the Air Mountains, an area of desert mountains and high plateaus,
            Ténéré desert and the Libyan desert, which is the most arid region.
            <br>
            In the north, the Sahara reaches to the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt and portions of Libya.
            In Cyrenaica and the Maghreb, the Sahara experiences a more Mediterranean climate with a winter rainy season.
